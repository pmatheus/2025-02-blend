**Note re: risk level upgrades/downgrades**

Two important notes about judging phase risk adjustments: 
- High- or Medium-risk submissions downgraded to Low-risk (QA) will be ineligible for awards.
- Upgrading a Low-risk finding from a QA report to a Medium- or High-risk finding is not supported.

As such, wardens are encouraged to select the appropriate risk level carefully during the submission phase.

# Additional context

## Main invariants

* User's cannot extract funds (borrow, withdraw) from a pool if they do not meet or exceed the minimum health factor

✅ SCOUTS: Please format the response above 👆 so its not a wall of text and its readable.

## Attack ideas (where to focus for bugs)
## Auctions

The protocol conducts auctions to both process liquidations and pay out backstop interest. Anything that can disrupt / block / break the creation or filling of these auctions has potential to impact the health of a pool and/or it's backstop.

The auction creation system was modified in v2 to allow auction creators to specify the assets in the bid/lot. https://github.com/blend-capital/blend-contracts-v2/issues/3

## Flash Loans

Blend v2 introduces a flash loans endpoint. These are slightly different than EVM based flash loans, but still allow external contracts to be invoked. with borrowed funds, and repaid afterwards, or remain borrowed with the appropriate amount of collateral.

## All trusted roles in the protocol

Pool
* admin - can add reserves, edit reserve configs, and edit pool config (EXCL. ORACLE)

Backstop
* N/A

Emitter

Pool Factory

## Describe any novel or unique curve logic or mathematical models implemented in the contracts:

* Interest uses a capped integral controller to adjust the interest rates to help utilization reach the target utilization rate: https://docs.blend.capital/blend-whitepaper#interest-rates
