/// This test demonstrates the vulnerability where a user can bypass the self-liquidation
/// prevention mechanism by using multiple accounts controlled by the same entity.
///
/// The vulnerability exists because the self-liquidation prevention check in the
/// fill_auction function only checks if the user address matches the filler address:
///
/// ```rust
/// pub fn fill(
///     e: &Env,
///     pool: &mut Pool,
///     auction_type: u32,
///     user: &Address,
///     filler_state: &mut User,
///     percent_filled: u64,
/// ) -> AuctionData {
///     if user.clone() == filler_state.address {
///         panic_with_error!(e, PoolError::InvalidLiquidation);
///     }
///     // ... rest of the function ...
/// }
/// ```
///
/// This check can be easily bypassed by using multiple addresses controlled by the same entity.
/// In a real-world scenario, a user could:
/// 1. Create a position with Account A
/// 2. When the position becomes liquidatable, use Account B (controlled by the same entity) to liquidate it
/// 3. This bypasses the self-liquidation prevention check since the addresses are different
///
/// The impact of this vulnerability is that users can effectively self-liquidate, which may allow
/// them to exploit certain market conditions or avoid penalties that would normally be applied
/// to liquidations by third parties.
///
/// A more robust solution would require some form of identity verification beyond simple address
/// comparison, but this is challenging in a decentralized environment.
